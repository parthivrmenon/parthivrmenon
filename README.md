### The Site Reliability Engineer's Oath :pencil2:

*In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of site reliability engineering...*

I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement...
- I will fearlessly and relentlessly **improve the reliability** of my services at every opportunity. I will never knowingly do anything degrade them.
- I will constantly and religiously measure my **SLIs** and use them to drive my decisions.
- I will not remain silent in the presence of harmful code. I will not knowingly allow code or design that is defective, anywhere near my production systems.
- I will ensure any **toil is measured**, marked and quickly **automated away** entirely.
- I will **build tools** that will help my developers be more productive. 
- I will be compassionate and kind to my developers. I will respect their craft and be sympathetic to their woes at all times.
- I will do all that I can to **"Keep The Light On"**. 
- I will not blame *"people"* when things go wrong. Mistakes happen, they are simply *opportunities to learn*.
- I will always have a healthy dose of symapthy for on-calls. I will ensure that alerts are actionable and on-call fatigue is low.
